# Discord-Card-Collection Bot
[Deprecated] Discord Card Collection Bot

Discord bot that simulated a trading card album. 

The user had points that could be obtained by doing different activities like a coin flip, trivia, and betting on matches. With those points, the user could open packs and received a card. The card was added to the album that could be visualized. If the card was already owned, it was added to the duplicates deck and could be added to the market or discarded. The market allowed users to see cards added by other users and had a fixed price, if the user was interested, they could buy it directly. 

Unfortunately, this bot is no longer functional as it was developed for Discord version 12 and is no longer compatible.

I created this bot 1 year ago while I was learning, so some structures can be optimized
